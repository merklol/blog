I am Maxim Smolyakov (**Russian:** _Максим Смоляков_), an Android developer. I was born in Moscow, currently living in China and frequently visit Norway. I have mostly worked with Kotlin and Java.

**My main interests are:**
- Android Development
- Kotlin/Java/JVM
- Kotlin Native
- C/C++
- Scala
- English
- Reactive and Functional Programming
- Game Development

**My favorite books about software engineering:**
- [Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne - Algorithms, 4th edition](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~snyder/cs112/CourseMaterials/AlgorithmsChapterOne.pdf)
- [Reactive Programming in Kotlin](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-kotlin)
- [Advanced Android App Architecture](https://www.scribd.com/document/462097394/Advanced-Android-App-Architecture-First-Edition-Real-world-app-architecture-in-Kotlin-1-3-by-Yun-Cheng-Aldo-Olivares-Dominguez-z-lib-org-pdf)

Besides programming, I am interested in traveling and have been traveling independently around Asia and Europe for the last five years. 

I did some volunteering in China for a year while I was studying at Zhejiang University of Science and Technology.

I lived in Seoul, South Korea, and studied at a language school over there for half a year.

This blog is my way to document things related to algorithms, programming, Java, Kotlin, and Android that I find interesting for myself.
